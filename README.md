# Xamarin Forms on Tizen

This repository is mean't to store snippets of code/XAML for using Xamarin Forms with Tizen (as well as Tizen.Wearable.CircularUI.Forms). The aim is to demonstrate different UI elements. 

Each UI element will be stored in it's own folder off of the relevent library (i.e. Xamarin.Forms or Tizen.Wearable.CircularUI.Forms) as a snippet of XAML along with a screen shot for quick reference.

As I started implementing these I came across https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.CircularUI/guide/Overview.html, checkout the User Interface section which shows some similar (and in cases more complete) examples of the code in this repos.
